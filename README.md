# BiometricPractice
A single place to document my practice using biometric libraries (facial recognition, voice, gait, etc). NOTHING HERE IS COMPLETE!

# Why is this here?
I've been experimenting with facial, voice, emotion, etc. recognition using biometrics. It is relevant to my work at NeuroTech@UIUC, and I also plan to use these in future projects. As of 2/10/2026, I am still practicing using these kinds of libraries (I am not yet an expert). This repository is meant to document my efforts, for anyone whom it may concern.

# DISCLAIMER
Nothing in this repository is complete software. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! This is only to document my own practice using these technologies, not for production use.
